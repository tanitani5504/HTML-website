            <h1>What is it exactly?</h1>
            <p>Inspired by circus performances and using suspended apparatus,
            the athletes involved in this exercise perform spectacular and scenic movements.
            On top of that, also the height at which everything happens makes everything even more spectacular:
            from 4 to 10 meters from the ground.
            </p>
            <p>Falls, turns, acrobatics and shapes drawn with the body: a unique hybrid between athletic practice and dance.
